## Conviction Voting 
- [BlockScience conviction voting Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/BlockScience/conviction/blob/master/cic_initialization.ipynb) - Such code. Many maths.
- [1Hive conviction voting chat](https://keybase.io/team/1hive) - This is where most of the in depth discussions happen around 1Hive's conviction voting implementation, but to join you have to create a Keybase account, join the 1Hive team chat, and then add yourself to the #conviction-voting chat.
- [1Hive conviction voting Discord chat](https://discord.gg/5D482sd) - Easy to join, but less activity.


## Notes

> Would be great to showcase 1-3 cases covering various steps of the total process initial vision > stakeholder map > system design > selecting component > simulations > behavioral data & attack vectors > security > living digital twin.
