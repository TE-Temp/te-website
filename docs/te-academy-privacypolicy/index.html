Additionally, we will also send marketing emails for those users who have participated in webinars organized by third parties and have consented to be contacted. </p><p>We will also publish and share photos and videos of our events should you consent to them. In the vast majority of cases, when organizing an event, we will use service providers that collect consent to record in advance. If we do not have this functionality, we will inform you in advance of the event so that if you do not want your photos or names to be published, you can disable the camera and/or enter a name other than your real name. </p><p>You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us directly. The withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before. You can also opt-out from the e-mail subscription by clicking the appropriate button in our emails to you.</p><p><strong>Legitimate Interests</strong></p><p>We will process your work-related data for suggesting to Partners the suitable candidates in our and partners’ legitimate interests. We will ensure that suitable safeguards, such as pseudonymisation of your data, will be in place to share this data. We won’t share your name and contact details with third parties unless you consent to it. </p><p>We will also process your enquiries-related data sent to our contact emails for our legitimate interests. We process this data for providing you with support and replying to any queries you may have. </p><p><strong>Legal Compliance</strong></p><p>If we are subject to any legal requirements to retain the data of our users, we will process the collected details to comply with law requirements. An example of such a situation will be the storing of employees’ emergency contact details. In this scenario, the legal ground for the processing will be compliance with our legal obligations.</p><p><strong>Data subject rights</strong></p><p>You may exercise GDPR rights regarding your personal data. In particular, you have the right to:</p><p><strong>The right to object against the processing of your information.</strong>
If we process your information for our legitimate interests (e.g., for replying to queries or storing applicant’s work-related data), you can object against it. Let us know what you object against and we will consider your request. If there are no compelling interests for us to refuse to perform your request, we will stop the processing for such purposes. If we believe our compelling interests outweigh your right to privacy, we will clarify this to you. </p><p><strong>The right to access your information.</strong>
You have the right to know what personal data we process. As such you can obtain the disclosure of the data involved in the processing and you can obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing.</p><p><strong>The right to verify your information and seek its rectification.</strong>
If you find that we process inaccurate or out-of-date information, you can verify the accuracy of your information and/or ask for it to be updated or corrected;
Restrict the processing of your information.
When you contest the accuracy of your information, believe we process it unlawfully or want to object against the processing, you have the right to temporarily stop the processing of your information to check if the processing was consistent. In this case, we will stop processing your data (other than storing it) until we are able to provide you with evidence of its lawful processing; </p><p><strong>The right to have your personal data deleted.</strong>
If we are not under the obligation to keep the data for legal compliance and your data is not needed in the scope of an active contract or claim, we will remove your information upon your request.</p><p><strong>The right to have your personal data transferred to another organisation.</strong>
Where we process your personal data on the legal basis of consent you provided us or on the necessity to perform a contract, we can make, at your request, your data available to you or to an organisation of your choosing. </p><p>You can formulate such requests or channel further questions on data protection by contacting us at <a href="mailto:contact@conectopia.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact@conectopia.io</a>.</p><p>If you believe that our use of personal information violates your rights, or if you are dissatisfied with a response you received to a request you formulated to us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority of your choice. </p><p>Available authorities in Europe can be found here:
